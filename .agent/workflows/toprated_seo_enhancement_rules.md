description: Global rules for TopRated SEO page enhancement workflow

## Rules

1. **No verification after building.** Do NOT use browser subagents to verify pages, take screenshots, or run content checks after generating pages. Just build the content and regenerate pages.
2. **No auto-commit.** Do NOT commit or push to GitHub after building. Only commit and push when the user explicitly asks.
3. **Build fast.** Focus on: research → enhance SEO content → enhance business listings → regenerate pages. That's it.
