From traditional omakase sushi counters in the CBD to izakaya-style bars on Courtenay Place, ramen houses on Cuba Street, and contemporary Japanese fusion on the waterfront, Wellington offers an impressive breadth of Japanese cuisine. The city's access to pristine New Zealand seafood gives its Japanese restaurants a unique advantage — fish so fresh it rivals Tokyo's best.</p>
